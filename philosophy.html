            <h4>Theory of Deterrence</h4>
            <div class="top-box-sub2">

                <p>The earliest recorded execution took place in 1608 in the colony of Jamestown where a Capt. George Kendall was found guilty of spying for the french</p>
                <p>The death Penalty has been a long standing component of our American legal tradition and goes to the role punishment plays in society more broadly. The legal theory which underpins this tradition is a four pronged set of practical principles
                    described as Retribution, Deterrence, Incapacitation, and Rehabilitation (Brumm, 1996). Retribution implies a direct cost to the taking of life. The old testament adage of “an eye for an eye” is perhaps most accurate in explaining
                    the social view of retribution. But more importantly the state attempts to take the role of judge and jury from those family and friends who perhaps left to their own may not afford the same considerations of an ordered court proceeding,
                    thereby introducing a kind of civility to the legal execution of justice. By way of Incapacitation, there can be little doubt that those who undergo the final judgment of capital punishment are indefinitely incapacitated and so are
                    no longer able to cause further injury or harm to society. Deterrence is the notion of attempting to ascribe a consequence to a crime that ultimately leads in the discouragement of further participation in that crime. Interestingly
                    enough, each of these four root principles can and have actually played a role in deterring potential criminals from committing future crimes</p>

            <h4>Death and Law</h4>
            <div class="top-box-sub2">

                <p>The Question of capital punishment has found its way to the courts in a number of instances. There are as many as eight case decisions within our jurisprudence which speak to the legal guidelines and proper application of the death penalty.
                    In fact in 1972 the US. Supreme court, for the first time, actually found the death penalty in contradiction with the US. Constitution in Furman v. Georgia on the grounds that it violated the eighth and fourteenth amendments of the
                    constitution. But the courts weren’t done, the question of death as a punishment would come to the courts yet again, this time reinstating the death penalty in 1977 after a number of death sentence challenges. </p>
                <p>Those who oppose it often cite for inspiration, Chief Justice Warren’s axiom of “the amendments must draw it’s meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.”</p>
                <p>Is it as John Stuart Mill asserts on the notion of life long imprisonment being in fact the “cruelest of punishments” and that “people would become more shocked at the taking of a human life than by the imposition of a long period of imprisonment
                    with hard labor that deprives the offender of all that makes life desirable or valuable.”(Ten, C.L.,141). But how can we say the death penalty is unconstitutional if the founders where not only aware of the death penalty but saw its
                    imposition in a number of crimes of the day?</p>
                <p>The author Richard J. Broughton in the article The Death Penalty and Justice Scalia’s Line refers to the same named Supreme Court Justice and the founder’s inferred knowledge of the death penalty in both the fifth amendment’s due process
                    clause (which forbids the government from depriving persons of “life” without due process) and its indictment clause (which refers specifically to the indictment of “capital” crimes)(Broughton, 207).</p>
