                <p>The national polls have long showed a majority support for the death penalty with an overwhelming 76% in support of the measure. However, Radelet and Akers noticed a significant variation when poll questions where restated to ask whether
                    individuals would support the death penalty if evidence showed there was not a deterrent effect. The authors found support for the death penalty dropped nearly a quarter to 52% support. The take away from the experiment was to illustrate
                    the profound weight the public places on the ideal of deterrence in relation to the death penalty.</p>

            <h4>Academic Studies</h4>
            <div class="top-box-sub2">

                <p>Using an extensive state level data set ranging from 1977 to 1997, Professor H. Naci Mocan and R. Kaj Gittings of the University of Colorado, Denver found that for every five commutations of a death sentence, five additional murders resulted</p>
                <p>The Deterrence theory assumes criminals to be responsive to cost/ benefit analysis when deciding whether to commit a crime or not. Criminals “rationally maximize their own self-interest (utility) subject to constraints (prices, incomes)
                    that they face in the marketplace and elsewhere” Professor Joanna Shepherd of Emory Law, has also found significant support for the deterrence affect from her analysis of monthly crime statistical data from 1977 to 1999 and cites three
                    important findings from that data. First, each execution, on average, is associated with three fewer murders. The deterred murders included both crimes of passion and murders by intimates. Second, executions deter the murder of whites
                    and African-Americans. Each execution prevents the murder of one white person, 1.5 african-Americans, and 0.5 persons of other races. And third, shorter waits on death row are associated with increased deterrence. For each additional
                    2.75-year reduction in the death row wait until execution, one murder is deterred</p>
                <p>One of the most cited and hotly contested studies on capital punishment comes by way of Isaac Ehrlich and Joel C. Gibbons. Professors in economics, their article entitled On the Measurement of the Deterrent Effect of Capital Punishment
                    and the Theory of Deterrence, introduced substantive evidence for the proposition that capital punishment had an observable deterrent effect throughout the United States in the early 20th century. The Paper postulated that between
                    1933 and 1969, eight homicides had been prevented for every execution conducted within those years.(Erhlich, Gibbons, 38) The study looked at the national murder rate in relation to three distinct probabilities: arrest, conviction,
                    and executions. From these factors, a cost to supply ratio was made whereby allowing one to observe a direct cost to murder rates relative to those three fold factors. </p>
